# FCPP Starting Exercises

Quick-start aggregate computing exercises. The exercises themselves are described in the [run/exercises.cpp](https://github.com/fcpp/fcpp-exercises/blob/master/run/exercises.cpp) file. All commands below are assumed to be issued from the cloned git repository folder. For any issues, please contact [Giorgio Audrito](mailto:giorgio.audrito@unito.it).

## Setup

The next sections contain the FCPP setup instructions for the various supported OSs. Jump to the section dedicated to your system of choice and ignore the others.

### Windows

Pre-requisites:
- [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org) (for issuing unix-style commands)
- [MinGW-w64](http://mingw-w64.org) ([builds 8.1.0](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/installer/mingw-w64-install.exe/download))
- [CMake 3.9](https://cmake.org) (or higher)

During CMake installation, make sure you select to add `cmake` to the `PATH` (at least for the current user).
During MinGW installation, make sure you select "posix" threads (should be the default) and not "win32" threads. After installing MinGW, you need to add its path to the environment variable `PATH`. The default path should be:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\mingw-w64\i686-8.1.0-posix-dwarf-rt_v6-rev0\mingw32\bin
```
but the actual path may vary depending on your installation.

### Linux

Pre-requisites:
- Xorg-dev package (X11)
- G++ 9 (or higher)
- CMake 3.9 (or higher)

To install these packages in Ubuntu, type the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install xorg-dev g++ cmake
```
In Fedora, the `xorg-dev` package is not available. Instead, install the packages:
```
libX11-devel libXinerama-devel.x86_6 libXcursor-devel.x86_64 libXi-devel.x86_64 libXrandr-devel.x86_64 mesa-libGL-devel.x86_64
```

### MacOS

Pre-requisites:
- Xcode Command Line Tools
- CMake 3.9 (or higher)

To install them, assuming you have the [brew](https://brew.sh) package manager, type the following commands:
```
xcode-select --install
brew install cmake
```

### Virtual Machines

If you use a VM with a graphical interface, refer to the section for the operating system installed on it.

**Warning:** the graphical simulations are based on OpenGL, and common Virtual Machine software (e.g., VirtualBox) has faulty support for OpenGL. If you rely on a virtual machine for graphical simulations, it might work provided that you select hardware virtualization (as opposed to software virtualization). However, it is recommended to use the native OS whenever possible.


## Execution

In order to execute the exercises file, type the following command in a terminal:
```
> ./make.sh gui run -O exercises
```
Running the above command, you should see output about building the executables then the graphical simulation should pop up while the console will show the most recent `stdout` and `stderr` outputs of the application, together with resource usage statistics (both on RAM and CPU).  During the execution, log files will be generated in the `output/` repository sub-folder. If a batch of multiple simulations is launched (which is not the case for the `exercises` target), individual simulation results will be logged in the `output/raw/` subdirectory, with the overall resume in the `output/` directory).

### Graphical User Interface

Executing a graphical simulation will open a window displaying the simulation scenario, initially still: you can start running the simulation by pressing `P` (current simulated time is displayed in the bottom-left corner). While the simulation is running, network statistics will be periodically printed in the console. You can interact with the simulation through the following keys:

- `Esc` to end the simulation
- `P` to stop/resume
- `O`/`I` to speed-up/slow-down simulated time
- `L` to show/hide connection links between nodes
- `G` to show/hide the grid on the reference plane and node pins
- `M` enables/disables the marker for selecting nodes
- `left-click` on a selected node to open a window with node details
- `C` resets the camera to the starting position
- `Q`,`W`,`E`,`A`,`S`,`D` to move the simulation area along orthogonal axes
- `right-click`+`mouse drag` to rotate the camera
- `mouse scroll` for zooming in and out
- `left-shift` added to the camera commands above for precision control
- any other key will show/hide a legenda displaying this list

Hovering on a node will also display its UID in the top-left corner.


## Project Inspection

This project consists of four files (besides git configuration files):

- [run/exercises.cpp](https://github.com/fcpp/fcpp-exercises/blob/master/run/exercises.cpp). This contains the actual C++ code (using the FCPP library) that will be run. In-line documentation is provided to show the purpose of its various parts. This file consists of three sections with different purposes:
    - First, the **introduction** section imports the FCPP library and declares a series of _tags_ (empty types) and _constexpr_ constants to be later used both in the _aggregate program_ and _system setup_.
    - Then, the **aggregate program** section specifies the behaviour to be executed on the distributed system, through a _field calculus_-like dialect of C++.
    - Finally, the **system setup** section specifies the execution settings under which the program is to be run, encoding them into empty types that are passed as options to the main FCPP classes.

  More details on these sections are given below.
- [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/fcpp/fcpp-exercises/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt). This contains the CMake configuration for the project. The first four commands (line 1-8) ensure that the FCPP library is properly loaded. After defining the project, the execution targets can be declared through:
  ```
  fcpp_target(executable_path has_gui)
  ```
  where `has_gui` can be either `ON` or `OFF`. The file nameÂ (without directory and extensions) of every declared target needs to be unique. If needed, automated tests can similarly be defined through:
  ```
  fcpp_test(executable_path)
  ```
- [make.sh](https://github.com/fcpp/fcpp-exercises/blob/master/make.sh). This script provides a friendly interface to the build and execution tools. Launching `./make.sh` without arguments shows the relevant help. The most common usages are:
    - `./make.sh doc`: build the doxygen documentation (needs a `Doxyfile` such as the one available in [fcpp/src/Doxyfile](https://github.com/fcpp/fcpp/blob/master/src/Doxyfile) to be present in the main repository folder)
    - `./make.sh gui run -O all`: perform an optimised build and run of every target (with GUI enabled)
    - `./make.sh test all`: perform all automated tests
- [README.md](https://github.com/fcpp/fcpp-exercises/blob/master/README.md), which is this file.


## Aggregate Program

The _Aggregate Program_ section consists of a sequence of definitions: pure C++ functions, auxiliary aggregate functions and a main aggregate function, together with the definition of their _exports_.

### The main aggregate function

Every aggregate program should have a single main aggregate function, which is the starting point of the aggregate program executed in every round by every node in the network. Its body can then issue calls to other aggregate functions, as well as pure C++ functions (see _Function call patterns_ below). The main aggregate function (not to be confused with the *main* function of the C++ application built on top of FCPP) is defined as follows:
```
MAIN() {
   ...
}
```
where `MAIN` is a [macro](http://fcpp-doc.surge.sh/beautify_8hpp.html) defining a callable class `main` with the given body. Besides its special role as program entry point, this function works as any other aggregate function, including the need to define an _export list_ (see _Aggregate function definition and exports_ below). 

### Aggregate function definition and exports

An *aggregate function* (i.e., a function that contains calls to *aggregate operators* or other aggregate functions) must be defined in a special way, compared to a pure C++ function. For non-templated functions, the definition schema is the following:
```
FUN return_type name(ARGS, arguments) { CODE
   ...
}
FUN_EXPORT name_t = common::export_list<...>;
```
where:
- `return_type` is the return type of the function;
- `name` is the name of the function;
- `arguments` is the list of arguments accepted by the function;
- `FUN`,  `ARGS`, and `CODE` are C++ macros that *instrument* the function to support coordination operators (injecting a reference to the `node` object, and keeping track of the stack frame of function calls to allow automatic alignment of messages);
- conventionally, the function name with an `_t` suffix (using `main_t` for the `MAIN` function) is used to declare the _export list_.

The export list is the sequence of types that are used in the coordination operators appearing in the body of the function. This information is crucial, in order to properly set up the data structures collecting the messages that need to be exchanged. In that list, all the types of the `old`, `nbr` or `oldnbr` (see _Coordination operators_ below) appearing in the body should be included. In addition, for every function call in the body to an aggregate function `aggrfun` an item `aggrfun_t` should also be included, to recursively include the types needed within the body of that function. For instance:
```
FUN_EXPORT main_t = common::export_list<double, field<int>, abf_hops_t>;
```
declares that the `MAIN` function is directly using coordination operators exchanging information of type either `double` or `field<int>`, in addition to performing a call to the aggregate function `abf_hops`.

Aggregate functions, like pure C++ function, can also be templated to accept different types for their arguments. These are called _generic aggregate functions_, and have the following definition schema:
```
GEN(...) return_type name(ARGS, arguments) { CODE
...
}
GEN_EXPORT name_t = common::export_list<...>;
```
As you can see, the scheme is almost identical, except that:
- `GEN(...)` is used instead of `FUN`, to declare the parameter types;
- similarly, `GEN_EXPORT` is used instead of `GEN` with the list of relevant parameter types.

In particular, generic types are needed to reliably implement higher-order functions, accepting function arguments. Towards this aim, a further `BOUND( F, R(T...) )` clause can be included to bound the generic type `F` to be callable as a function with given signature `R(T...)`. For instance:
```
GEN(T, F, BOUND( F, T(T,T) )) gossip(ARGS, T value, F&& accumulate) { CODE
...
}
GEN_EXPORT(T) gossip_t = common::export_list<T>;
```
is the definition of the generic aggregate function [`coordination::gossip`](http://fcpp-doc.surge.sh/collection_8hpp.html). This function accepts a value of a generic type `T` and an accumulating function of a generic type `F`, which needs to be callable with two `T` arguments and return a `T` result.

### Function call patterns

Pure calls, aggregate calls, built-in calls, common built-ins.

### Basic types

Numeric aliases; colors, shapes and vecs; tuples and operators; fields and operators ([API reference](http://fcpp-doc.surge.sh/dir_a649fd95b532dff35a9ca005b15ee438.html)). This includes `to_field` and `to_local` and the concepts of default/exceptions of a field (and how they can be applied to locals as well).

### Coordination operators

FCPP contains three operations peculiar to the *Aggregate Programming* model, allowing to:

- share information with neighbours (`nbr`)
- recall values computed in the previous round (`old`)
- do both things simultanously (`oldnbr`)

See also the [FCPP presentation paper](http://giorgio.audrito.info/static/fcpp.pdf) and the [API reference](http://fcpp-doc.surge.sh/calculus_8hpp.html) for detailed information. 

The `nbr` operator comes in four flavors, with increasing level of expressiveness, differing from their argument number and type:

- `to_field<A> nbr(ARGS, A const& f)`
    - `f`: a value of type `A` to be sent to neighbours.
    - *returns:* a neighbouring field, where the default value coincides with the default of `f`, and exceptions are the most recent values for the current device sent by neighbours through the `f` they passed on their round (including the previous round of the current devices, if there was one).
    - *equivalent to:* `nbr(CALL, f, f)`
- `to_field<A> nbr(ARGS, A const& f0, A const& f)`
    - `f0`: a value of type `A` to be used as default for the returned value.
    - `f`: a value of type `A` to be sent to neighbours.
    - *returns:* a neighbouring field, where the default value coincides with the default of `f0`, and exceptions are the most recent values for the current device sent by neighbours through the `f` they passed on their round (including the previous round of the current devices, if there was one).
    - *equivalent to:* 
      ```
      nbr(CALL, f0, [](to_field<A> fn){
        return make_tuple(fn, f);
      })
      ```
- `A nbr(ARGS, A const& f0, G&& op)`
    - `f0`: a value of type `A` used as a default value for any device in the field of `A` that is produced
    - `op`: a lambda function of type `to_field<A>` â `A`; a neighbouring field of `A` is populated as in the previous form of `nbr`, then a value of type `A` is obtained by applying `op` to such field
    - *returns:* TODO
    - *equivalent to:*
      ```
      nbr(CALL, f0, [](to_field<A> fn){
        A fx = op(fn);
        return make_tuple(fx, fx);
      })
      ```
- `B nbr(ARGS, A const& f0, G&& op)`
    - `f0`: a value of type `A` used as a default value for any device in the field of `A` that is produced
    - `op`: a lambda function of type `to_field<A>` â `tuple<B,A>`; a neighbouring field of `A` is populated as in the previous form of `nbr`, then a tuple with a `B` value and an an `A` value is obtained by applying `op` to such field
    - *returns:* TODO

Note that the first two forms return a `to_field<A>` value, as explained in *Basic types* above, while the 3rd and 4th forms, instead, return a plain `A` (resp. `B`) value. All the returned values can then be used in further computations during the current round. At the end of the round, all forms cause the FCPP library to send to the neighbouring devices the computed `A` value associated with the current device, that for the 1st and 2nd forms is the last argument itself, while for the 3rd and 4th forms is obtained from the result of `op`.
